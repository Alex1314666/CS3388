Thoughts on Computer Graphic Course to share
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Assignment1
The purpose of this assignment is to complete the Python class graphicsWindow found in file graphicsWindow.py. You are asked to program a method drawLine(p1,p2,color) that draws a line in the image from point p1 to point p2 with color color. The points p1 and p2 are expressed as tuples (x,y). The color is also a tuple of the form (r,g,b) where r,g,b are values between 0 and 255. The method drawLine(p1,p2,color) must: 
  * implement Bresenham's integer line drawing algorithm correctly, for lines of all slopes
  * be properly documented (Header comments: descrpition of parameters, what the method does, and description of output.
    Code comments: description of nonobvious sections of code)
  * The class graphicsWindow is available in the Resources Section of OWL, under Python Code 
  * Do not change file name nor the actual name of the graphicsWindow class 
  * Make sure your method drawLine(p1,p2,color) is actually called drawLine 
  * Repsect the type and order of the parameters 
  * Use the following Python program to test Drawline(p1,p2,color) 
  * The output of the test program should correspond exactly to this image
  * Use OWL to submit the file graphicsWindow.py containing your method drawLine(p1,p2,color) 
You must use Python 3.7 and PyCharm 2018.2 or above for this assignment. Before submitting your assignment, please refer to the assignment marking scheme and submission guidelines.
